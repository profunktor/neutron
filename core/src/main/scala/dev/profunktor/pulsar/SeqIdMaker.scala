  *
  * - A previous sequence id (-1 if there are no previous messages).
  * - A previous payload (message).
  * - A new payload.
  *
  * An instance has to be contructed explicitly and pass it to `withDeduplication`
  * in the producer settings. It could be a typeclass but it makes things awkward
  * when deduplication is not required.
  *
  * You can either build one via either the `fromEq` or the `instance` constructors.
